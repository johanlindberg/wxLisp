## wxLisp - Common Lisp bindings for wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, OS X and Linux on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures as well as several mobile platforms. It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives its applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free, open-source and mature.

This will be my entry in the 2013 [Lisp In Summer Projects](http://lispinsummerprojects.org/) competition.

I plan to use CFFI and will work on the project from two different machines. One running Lubuntu + SBCL and the other Mac OS X 10.6 + Clozure CL.  

### TODO

#### Preparation

[ ] Get wxWidgets 2.8.12 running on Lubuntu/Mac OS X 10.6.
[X] Update to latest versions of SBCL/CCL, SLIME and Emacs/Aquamacs.
