## wxLisp - Common Lisp bindings for wxWidgets

wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, OS X and Linux on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures as well as several mobile platforms. It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives its applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free, open-source and mature.
